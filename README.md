# Coderbnb

[Coderbnb live][heroku]

[heroku]: http://coder-bnb.herokuapp.com

  CoderBnB is a web application inspired by Airbnb built with Ruby on Rails, and React/Redux. The idea is to group coders together and code all night. It utilizes Ruby on Rails on the backend, a PostgreSQL database, and React.js with a Redux architectural framework on the frontend.  

## Features & Implementation

### Spot Listing And Map

  User can selectively see spots in the spot index view. There are two components in the spot index view: search result and map view. The search result lists all spots and provides different robust filters to help user choose spot to stay. The date picker implements Airbnb's official DateRangePicker component.

### Notebooks

Implementing Notebooks started with a notebook table in the database.  The `Notebook` table contains two columns: `title` and `id`.  Additionally, a `notebook_id` column was added to the `Note` table.  

The React component structure for notebooks mirrored that of notes: the `NotebookIndex` component renders a list of `CondensedNotebook`s as subcomponents, along with one `ExpandedNotebook`, kept track of by `NotebookStore.selectedNotebook()`.  

`NotebookIndex` render method:

```javascript
render: function () {
  return ({this.state.notebooks.map(function (notebook) {
    return <CondensedNotebook notebook={notebook} />
  }
  <ExpandedNotebook notebook={this.state.selectedNotebook} />)
}
```

### Tags

As with notebooks, tags are stored in the database through a `tag` table and a join table.  The `tag` table contains the columns `id` and `tag_name`.  The `tagged_notes` table is the associated join table, which contains three columns: `id`, `tag_id`, and `note_id`.  

Tags are maintained on the frontend in the `TagStore`.  Because creating, editing, and destroying notes can potentially affect `Tag` objects, the `NoteIndex` and the `NotebookIndex` both listen to the `TagStore`.  It was not necessary to create a `Tag` component, as tags are simply rendered as part of the individual `Note` components.

## Future Directions for the Project

In addition to the features already implemented, I plan to continue work on this project.  The next steps for FresherNote are outlined below.

### Search

Searching notes is a standard feature of Evernote.  I plan to utilize the Fuse.js library to create a fuzzy search of notes and notebooks.  This search will look go through tags, note titles, notebook titles, and note content.  

### Direct Messaging

Although this is less essential functionality, I also plan to implement messaging between FresherNote users.  To do this, I will use WebRTC so that notifications of messages happens seamlessly.
